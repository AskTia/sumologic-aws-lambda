SumoLogic AWS Lambda Functions
==============================

## What does AWS Lambda do? ##
AWS Lambda is a compute service that allows users to run code, in response to events, without having to provision and manage servers. A Lambda Function can be triggered automatically from other Amazon services, or from a web or mobile application.  For more information, please visit the [AWS Lambda site](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

## What do Sumo Logic Lambda Functions do? ##
Sumo Logic Lambda Functions are designed to collect and process data from a variety of sources and pass it onto the Sumo Logic platform. Here, the data can be stored, aggregated, searched, and visualized for a variety of insightful use cases.

## What are the different Sumo Logic Lambda Functions available? ##
We currently support a Lambda Function for Amazon CloudWatch Logs. As CloudWatch Logs become available, the Lambda Function processes the data and passes it along to the Sumo Logic platform. Users can then use Sumo Logic’s rich visualizations to easily troubleshoot and monitor their applications and systems hosted on AWS.
